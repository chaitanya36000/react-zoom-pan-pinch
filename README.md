# react-zoom-pan-pinch

## Local Changes

````bash
npm run build
npm run link
# in consumer project
npm link

## Test

Happy with the local change? ✅

## Deployment

```bash
npm pack
````

- A new `.tgz` package will be created
- Go to GitHub → create or update a release → upload the `.tgz` file

## Usage in Consumer

```bash
npm i "download_url_or_package"
```

```

Do you want me to make this even **shorter like a step-by-step checklist** (1-liner per step)?
